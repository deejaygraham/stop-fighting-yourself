  - Communcation helps us build better software
  - Helps us understand

  - Cycles modify behaviour 
  - Feedback from the code: how have your changes affected the overall system for good or bad.
  - Feedback from the team: concrete feedback in the form of acceptance tests or scripts test overall system. How close are we to done?
  - Feedback from the customer: what to work on next, based on current state of system.
